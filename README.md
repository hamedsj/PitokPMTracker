## 🧩 Extended Features

* Support for Manifest V3
* Works with Firefox
* Improved syntax highlighting
* Better code formatting for easier reading
* Filters postMessages from other extensions

## 🛠️ NPM Development Workflow

This repo now ships an npm-based layout to make development and packaging easier, without changing the core algorithm that finds postMessage listeners.

- Install Node 18+.
- Commands:
  - `npm test` — runs Node tests for popup helpers.
  - `npm run build` — writes packaged extension files to `dist/chrome` and `dist/firefox`.

### Load Unpacked from dist

After running `npm run build`:
- Chrome: load `dist/chrome` as the unpacked extension.
- Firefox: load `dist/firefox` (or zip it to an XPI) as the extension directory.

## 📖 Usage

You can also build locally: run `npm run build` and load the `dist/firefox` directory as a temporary extension. To package, zip `dist/firefox` into an `.xpi` and install it.

✅ Congratulations you successfully loaded the extension
